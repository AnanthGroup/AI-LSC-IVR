# AI-LSC-IVR
AI-LSC-IVR is a code written in Python3 to perform ab initio nonadiabatic dynamics using linearized semiclassical initial value representation (LSC-IVR). The current version of the code is interfaced with an electronic structure package GAMESS and computes an electronic population correlation function using Wigner, semiclassical, or spin mapping population estimator. See the following references for the implementation and the application of the code:
